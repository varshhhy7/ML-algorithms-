# ML Algorithms

A curated collection of machine learning algorithms **from scratch**, with a strong focus on the underlying mathematics and complete code implementations. This repository is designed to help you deeply understand how ML algorithms work and how to implement them efficiently in both Python (with and without frameworks) and C++.

## 🚀 What You'll Find Here

- **Mathematical Derivations**: Step-by-step breakdowns for every algorithm  
- **Scratch Implementations**: Build ML models from first principles—no libraries at first  
- **Framework Integrations**: See how each algorithm maps to libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch  
- **C++ Code**: Efficient, competitive-programming-friendly C++ versions  
- **Clear Explanations**: Theory, code, and intuition in every notebook and file  
- **Well-Commented Code**: Learn not just *what* works, but *why* it works
